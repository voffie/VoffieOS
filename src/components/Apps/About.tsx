            Hey, my name is Viktor SÃ¶derborg also known as Voffie online. I'm a
            Swedish web- & software developer and I got introduced to computers
            at an early age and have been interested in them as far as I can
            remember. At first, it was only video games, but as time passed I
            started to enjoy the more technical parts behind what makes video
            games and computers work. This was especially true during my last
            few years of education where I learned about coding, tools that help
            developers with their work, and a few programming languages.
